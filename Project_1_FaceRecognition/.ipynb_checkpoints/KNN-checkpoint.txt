KNN [K nearest neighbours]
- Simple machine learning algorithm
- Used for classification and regression
- Supervised learning
- majority vote
- No training O(1)
- All the work happens at quesfy times, for each query O(nlogn)
- non-Parametric
- Also used as Baseline algorithm, while devising new algorithm should give better accuracy
